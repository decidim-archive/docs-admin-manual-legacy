The platform is multi-language although it is not automatically translated. If it has been decided that the platform is to be in two languages, for example, Catalan and Spanish, the fields will have to be filled in for both languages. For each of the text fields you will have to click on “*CA*” to enter Catalan text and “*ES*” to enter Spanish text.

The fields that have to be filled in are:

- Configuration window (<<Configuration-window-fig>>):

* *Name*: the name of the platform, for example Formació Decidim.
* *Social*: the social media profile name(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, GitHub). Only the ones that are used.
* *Default locale*: select the default language the platform is to be opened with.
* *Reference prefix*: unique identifier or acronym of the local authority’s name that appears with the proposals, in face-to-face meetings, results etc.

- Appearance window (<<Appearance-window-fig>>):

* *Welcome text*: slogan (brief phrase) which appears on the main image. In the example here: “Benvingut/da a la Formació Decidim!”.
* *Call to action button path*: You can overwrite where the Call To Action button in the homepage links to. Use partial paths, not full URLs here. Accepts letters, numbers, dashes and slashes, and must start with a letter. The Call To Action button is shown in the homepage between the welcome text and the description. Example: https://meta.decidim.barcelona/processes/welcome
