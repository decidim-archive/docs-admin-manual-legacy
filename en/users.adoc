== Users

Managing administration users involves such tasks as: registering other administrators; validating user groups (organisations/ collectives) that have been registered and whose effective existence has been confirmed; managing temporary users created from Citizen Help and Information Offices to enable people who have no internet to take part in Decidim: recognising that a person has a certain position in the organisation (Oficializations) and authenticating that the person taking part is who they say they are (Verifications).^link:#ftnt6[[6]]^

To manage users, click on *USERS* in the *DASHBOARD* menu. The *USERS* window will open (Figure 16).

User groups can be directly validated in this window, once their existence has been confirmed, by clicking on the corresponding *Verify* icon.

To publicly accredit (officialise) that a person has a certain position/ post in the organisation, click on *Oficializations* in the Users submenu. The *OFICIALIZATIONS* window (Figure 19) will open, displaying a list with some of the users and the initiatives that can be carried out: *Officialize*, and where the person has already been officialised, *Reofficialize* or *Unofficialize*.
